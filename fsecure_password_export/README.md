# F-Secure Vault export file parser

## Purpose
F-Secure Vault (Part of Total) only allows you to export your passwords in .fsk format. <br>
This script parses the file and outputs a format that you can then import to Google Password Manager (Chrome).

## Note
* This script doesn't work properly on passwords saved from a mobile device as the url links to an Android App.
* You should ensure that all of your accounts have a URL set.
